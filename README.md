# Portfolio Website | This Is AAKASH
This repository contains the source code of the portfolio website that I've made for myself. The theme is completely (as in 100%) inspired by Spotify and is kept intuitive. The project is made using the amazing javascript framework Vue, and is deployed on Netlify as well as GitHub pages.
